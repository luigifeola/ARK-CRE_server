This folder contains the code for running the experiment of Collective Resource Exploitation, through MultipleARK.

The code is organised as follows:

* **ARK_Codes:** code to run the real robot experiments with [ARK][ARK_Repo] (the system for Augmented Reality for Kilobots)
* **ARGoS_simulation:** code to run the [ARGoS][ARGoS_Repo] physics-based simulations of the [Kilobot][KilobotPlugin_Repo] robot.
* **Kilobot_Codes:** control code of the Kilobots (same code for simulated and real robots)
